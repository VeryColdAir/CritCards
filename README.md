## Config

When you first launch the application, you will have to profile directory paths for both the hit and fumble decks. No cards are included with this application and must be supplied by the user. Cards must be named numerically with a leading zero for 1 through 9 (e.i. 01, 02, etc.). Larger decks 99+ cards are not supported currently, but could be split into two decks less than 100 cards. Once the game name and the directory paths are entered, it is saved and the configuration screen will not appear when you launch the game. It can be editted at a later time by pressing the Edit Configuration button on the main window.
